# Why Use Boilerplate!

## Overview
Boilerplate! is a powerful VS Code extension that streamlines your development workflow by making it effortless to create, manage, and deploy consistent file and folder templates across your projects.

## Key Benefits

### üöÄ Accelerate Development
- **Eliminate Repetitive Tasks**: Stop manually creating the same file structures over and over
- **Instant Project Scaffolding**: Set up new components, modules, or entire project structures in seconds
- **Consistent Starting Points**: Every new feature begins with your best-practice structure

### üß© Maintain Consistency
- **Standardized Code Structure**: Ensure all team members follow the same patterns
- **Enforce Best Practices**: Embed your coding standards directly into templates
- **Reduce Onboarding Time**: New team members can quickly adopt your patterns

### üîß Powerful Customization
- **Dynamic Variables**: Inject context-aware content with sophisticated variable substitution
- **Transformation Functions**: Format variables as PascalCase, kebab-case, and more
- **JavaScript Evaluation**: Execute JS code during template generation for complex logic
- **Multiple Template Sources**: Store templates in workspace, home directory, or import from Gist

### üíº Professional Use Cases
- **React Component Creation**: Generate components with styles, tests, and stories
- **API Development**: Create consistent controller/service/model structures
- **Documentation**: Deploy standard documentation templates with auto-filled metadata
- **Cross-Project Standards**: Maintain consistent patterns across multiple repositories

### üåê Team Collaboration
- **Share via Gist**: Import and export templates through GitHub Gists
- **Version Control**: Store workspace templates in your repository
- **Centralized Templates**: Maintain company standards in a shared location

## Real-World Scenarios

### For Individual Developers
Create personal templates for your preferred patterns - whether you're starting a new React component, setting up API endpoints, or documenting your code. Save hours of setup time and maintain consistency across your projects.

### For Development Teams
Establish and enforce team coding standards by creating shared templates. New team members can be instantly productive by using pre-approved structures and patterns. Reduce code reviews focused on structure rather than functionality.

### For Enterprise Organizations
Implement organization-wide standards across multiple teams and projects. Create templates for different frameworks and languages that embody your security practices, documentation requirements, and architectural patterns.

## Comparison to Alternatives
Unlike simple snippets or project generators, Boilerplate!:
- Works with any language or framework
- Integrates directly into your VS Code workflow
- Updates dynamically based on context
- Supports complex logic and transformations
- Doesn't require external tools or build processes

## Getting Started
Start small with a single template for your most common component type, then expand to more sophisticated use cases as you discover the power of the extension.

The most successful users begin by documenting their current file patterns, then converting them to templates, gradually adding more advanced variable substitutions and transformations.
